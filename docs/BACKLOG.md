# Nipuna LMS — Backlog

Open product decisions and gaps found while building. Newest at the bottom of each section.

## CRM connection

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| CRM must emit events | The CRM does not yet post `CourseUpserted`, `AdmissionQualified`, `AdmissionUpdated`, `AdmissionCancelled`, `FinanceSummaryUpdated` to `/api/v1/integrations/crm/events`. Needs an outbox + worker in `nipuna-crm` (guide §17) |
| Outbox delivery | `crm_outbox` rows are queued but not delivered; either build a worker that pushes to a CRM endpoint, or the CRM polls `GET /integrations/crm/status?since=` — decide with the CRM team |
| `lms_last_synced_at` | Set by the CRM when it applies a pull/push; the LMS reports `now` at pull time |
| Batch ownership | The CRM also has batches and allocations (`nipuna-crm` db 006). Decide which system owns batch creation; today the LMS owns batches and links a CRM batch by `crm_batch_id` |

## Integrations (not connected)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Google Workspace / Meet / Drive | Meet association and recording import are recorded as states against the `integrations` register; no Google API calls |
| WhatsApp / email / telephony | In-app notifications only |

## Admin & security

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Emergency / elevated access | Security control `EMERGENCY_ACCESS` (max 4 hours, reviewed afterwards) has no mechanism yet; only routine temporary access (7 days) is enforced |
| Student MFA | `students.mfa_status` exists but no second factor is implemented |
| Exception queue | `/admin/exceptions` and the `exception_queue` view belong to the dashboards phase |
| Integration alerts | A Failed integration verification does not yet notify anyone |
| Audit actor filter | The Actor filter lists staff only; student sign-ins are found by entity |
