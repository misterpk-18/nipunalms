# Nipuna CRM — Database

The schema, migration by migration, and the rules it enforces. Source of truth: the numbered SQL files in `db/`.

Tables are created in dependency order: a table is only built once everything it references exists.
Derived from the prototype at https://nipuna-crm-frozen-demo.nipunatech.chatgpt.site/ (sample data only).

**Core flow (V4, db 019–022):** Enquiry/Lead → Qualify (six checks) → Convert to deal → Counselling → Demo → Fee discussion (offer versions, special closing) → Accepted delivery plan per course → Invoice (one or more courses, 1–3 instalments) → Payment claim → Verification (receipt) → Admission per course (₹1,000 verified) → Collections → Batch/LMS → Placement

Every record is branch-scoped (NIT-GNT Guntur, NIT-VIJ Vijayawada). One canonical **Person** can have many leads and admissions. A lead is **Active** while at New Enquiry; once it is qualified and converted to a deal it is **Inactive** and the person is tracked on a pipeline card (017, 019).

Migration files live in `db/` and are applied in numeric order, each in its own transaction (009 must commit before 010):

```bash
psql -d nipunacrm -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -1 -f db/<file>.sql
```

The dev replica (`nipunacrm-dev`) and the pytest database (`nipunacrm_test`) are rebuilt from the same files — see [DEVELOPMENT.md · Part A (local development)](DEVELOPMENT.md#3-databases).

Phases 0–3 cover the complete sales-to-cash flow and are the MVP. Phases 4–6 can follow as their screens are built.

> **Read the "Prototype alignment" section at the end.** A full review of the prototype changed several earlier decisions (roles, payments before admission, advisory floor, fee changes). Where a phase section below disagrees with it, the alignment section wins.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `branches` | NIT-GNT, NIT-VIJ; code, name, city, receipt prefix (`GNT`, `VIJ`) |
| `roles` | Super Admin, Branch Manager, Counsellor, Admissions, Accounts, Academic Coordinator, Placement Team, Trainer |
| `users` | Staff logins; role, home branch (NULL = company-wide), case-insensitive unique email |
| `user_branches` | Extra branches a user can work in besides their home branch |
| `courses` | Standalone courses and combos (`is_combo`), standard fee, status |
| `course_branches` | Which branches offer each course (FK to `branches.branch_code`) |
| `combo_courses` | Component courses inside a combo; `is_bonus` marks the "+1" in a 3+1 combo |
| `lead_sources`, `contact_channels`, `entry_methods`, `payment_modes`, `lost_reasons` | Admin-editable dropdown values |
| `audit_log` | Append-only change history (UPDATE/DELETE blocked by trigger) |

Shared: `set_updated_at()` trigger keeps `updated_at` current on every table that has it.

## Phase 1 — People & sales pipeline ✅

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `number_sequences` | Counters behind readable codes; `next_number(key)` is concurrency-safe and gap-free (moved here from Phase 3) |
| `persons` | Canonical person; `person_code` auto-generated per branch (`PER-GNT-00001`). Phone indexed but not unique (siblings may share) |
| `leads` | Enquiry; `lead_code` auto-generated (`LD-00001`): person, course (optional), branch, source, channel, entry method, intake status, assigned user, stage, next follow-up, AI priority, lost reason / competitor / reactivation date |
| `lead_activities` | Timeline: calls, WhatsApp, notes, stage changes. Stage changes are logged automatically by trigger |
| `demos` | Lead, course, branch, time, duration (default 45 min), mode, trainer, status, reminder timestamps (confirmation / 24h / 1h), feedback, rating |

Lead stages: New Enquiry → Counselling → Demo Scheduled → Demo Attended → Fee Discussion / Payment Awaited → Payment Pending Verification → Admitted / Lost - closed

Rules enforced by the database:
- Moving a lead to `Lost - closed` requires `lost_reason_id`.
- A person can have only one open lead per course per branch (a new one is allowed after Admitted / Lost).
- Every stage change writes a `lead_activities` row. The app should run `SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = '<id>'` per transaction so it is attributed to the user.

## Phase 2 — Commercials ✅

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `offers` | Offer Master: `offer_code` + `version` (editing an Active offer = new version row); benefit (amount / percent / complimentary course), stacking, qualifying payment rule, validity dates |
| `offer_branches`, `offer_courses` | Scope when the offer isn't for all branches / all courses |
| `offer_complimentary_courses` | Free course with a minimum final fee (e.g. Advanced Excel when fee ≥ ₹15,000) |
| `payment_plans` + `payment_plan_installments` | Plan templates as % of fee with due days after admission. Seeded: Full Payment (100% on day 0) |
| `concession_limits` | Max extra concession each role can approve. Seeded: Branch Manager = lower of 5% or ₹1,000; Super Admin = unlimited. Roles without a row can't approve |
| `fee_discussions` | One negotiation per lead + course; `discussion_code` auto-generated (`FD-00001`); milestone; invoice number |
| `fee_discussion_versions` | v1, v2, v3…: standard fee, offer + offer discount, extra concession, final payable, floor, plan, valid until |
| `special_closing_requests` | Extra concession approval; `scr_code` auto-generated (`SCR-00001`); 5-minute decision target |

Rules enforced by the database:
- An offer can only be `Active` with an approver and start/end dates.
- Fee versions: `version_no` auto-increments; floor defaults to 70% of standard fee; validity defaults to 7 days or offer end, whichever is first.
- `final_payable` must equal standard fee − offer discount − extra concession, and can't go below the floor.
- Amounts on a saved version can't be edited (status can) — make a new version instead.
- Special closing: no self-approval; approver's role limit is checked; rejection needs a reason; `decided_at` is stamped automatically; only one pending request per version.

## Phase 3 — Admission & money ✅

| Table / view | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `admissions` | `admission_code` auto-generated per branch per year (`NIT-GNT-2026-000001`): person, lead, accepted fee version, course, original vs service branch, delivery mode, final fee, plan, counsellor, enrolment / curriculum / handover / LMS status, cancellation, `first_verified_payment_at` |
| `installments` | Generated automatically from the payment plan when the admission is created (rounding goes to the last installment) |
| `payments` | Immutable ledger. Receipts per collecting branch per financial year (`GNT-R-2627-00001`); reversals get `GNT-RV-2627-00001` |
| `payment_promises` | Collections promise-to-pay (Pending / Kept / Broken / Cancelled) |
| `refund_cases` | `NIT-RF-00001`: registration → financial decision → payout → reconciliation, each recorded separately |
| `refund_case_receipts` | Receipts a refund case relates to |
| `admission_balances` (view) | Final fee, verified paid, pending verification, waived, refunded, outstanding |
| `installment_dues` (view) | Per installment: covered / balance (verified money applied oldest-first), due position, days overdue, age band, contact hold |

Also added: role `FOUNDER_CEO` (company-wide, unlimited concession), function `fy_code(date)` → `'2627'`.

Rules enforced by the database:
- Admission `final_fee` must match the accepted fee version; fee, plan and admission date are frozen afterwards. Plan installments must add up to 100%.
- Creating an admission marks the fee discussion `Converted`.
- Payments can't be edited or deleted. Only verification changes, once: Pending Verification → Verified / Failed. Corrections are Reversal rows (exact negative of a Verified payment, one per payment).
- A payment mode that needs a reference (UPI, card, cheque) can't be saved without one. Payments can't exceed the outstanding amount (pending included).
- First verified payment stamps `first_verified_payment_at` ("New Paid Admission" date) and moves the lead to `Admitted`.
- Pending Verification money is excluded from verified totals and puts the student on contact hold.
- Cancelling an admission needs who, when and why.
- Refund / waiver decisions: Founder / CEO or Super Admin only; refund can't exceed verified payments. Payout can't be done by the decider, can't exceed the approved amount, and `Completed` requires reconciliation.

Ageing bands: 1–3 · 4–7 · 8–15 · 16–30 · 31–60 · 61–90 · 91+ days

## Phase 4 — Academics ✅

| Table / view | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `batches` | `batch_code` auto-generated per branch (`GNT-B-0001`): course (standalone only), branch, mode, trainer, schedule, dates, capacity, status, LMS course id |
| `batch_allocations` | Admission → batch. Combo admissions get one active allocation per component course. `joining_date` = first confirmed regular class (demos excluded) |
| `admission_transfers` | Service-branch history; inserting a transfer moves `admissions.service_branch_id` (original branch never changes) |
| `document_types` | Seeded: Identity proof (mandatory), Photograph, Address proof, Education certificate |
| `documents` | Uploaded files (path to storage), review status, reviewer, rejection reason |
| `certificates` | One live certificate per admission per course; number on issue per service branch + FY (`GNT-C-2627-00001`) |
| `batch_occupancy` (view) | Capacity, allocated, seats left per batch |
| `document_checklist` (view) | Each admitted person × each mandatory document type → Not Uploaded / Review Required / Verified / Rejected |

Also added: `persons.lms_user_id` (unique — one LMS identity per person), `persons.lms_provisioned_at`, `admissions.lms_last_synced_at`, `admissions.lms_last_activity_at`.

Rules enforced by the database:
- Batches can't be created for combo courses. An allocation's batch course must be the admission's course or one of its combo components.
- One active allocation per admission per course; batch capacity can't be exceeded; no allocations to cancelled admissions or completed/cancelled batches.
- Changing batch = close the allocation (`Moved` / `Withdrawn` / `Completed`, with `ended_at`) and create a new one; closed allocations can't be reopened.
- First allocation moves enrolment `Awaiting Batch Allocation` → `Scheduled`; first joining date moves it to `In Progress`.
- Transfers take `from_branch` from the admission's current service branch and must go to a different branch.
- Documents: one live file per person per type (re-upload only after rejection); rejection needs a reason; review time stamped automatically.
- Certificates: issuing assigns the number and time; issued/revoked certificates can't be re-issued (create a new one); revoking needs who, when and why.

## Phase 5 — Operations ✅

| Table / view | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `branch_channels` | Each branch's WhatsApp number / email / phone line; Manual or API |
| `communications` | Unified inbox: every message and call, direction, delivery status, failure reason, retry link, person/lead match, response SLA |
| `task_types` | Seeded: Call, Follow-up, Demo, Fee Discussion, Approval, Payment Verification, Collections, Document Review, Academic, Refund Case, General |
| `tasks` | Work queue: type, branch, owner (NULL = unassigned), team role, workflow status, original + revised deadline, one linked record (lead / demo / fee discussion / SCR / admission / payment / refund case / document / communication), `dedupe_key` for system tasks |
| `notification_rules` | Event → recipient role, warn / escalate minutes, escalation role. Seeded: SCR pending → Branch Manager (warn 4m, escalate 5m → Founder / CEO); payment pending verification → Accounts (warn 25m, escalate 30m → Branch Manager) |
| `notifications` | Separate timestamps for delivered, read, acknowledged, action completed; warn / escalate times; escalation chain; external WhatsApp / email status |
| `task_board` (view) | Due date (revised or original), overdue, due today, unassigned, linked record code |
| `communication_inbox` (view) | Queue (Match Review / Failed / Missed Calls / Awaiting Reply / Manual Activity) and SLA state (Within SLA / At Risk / Breached / Met / Met Late) |
| `notifications_due_for_escalation` (view) | Action-required notifications past escalation time and not yet escalated — the worker polls this |

Also added: `lead_activities.communication_id` links a timeline entry to its inbox item.

Rules enforced by the database:
- Task statuses are workflow only; Overdue / Unassigned are derived in `task_board`.
- A task links to at most one record. `original_due_at` never changes; a revised deadline needs a reason; Waiting/Blocked needs a reason; Cancelled needs a reason; Completed stamps who and when. Completed / Cancelled tasks can't be reopened.
- `dedupe_key` stops system jobs creating the same task twice.
- Inbox: a Matched item must have a person; Failed needs a reason; an item needing a response needs a due time.
- Notifications are deduplicated by event + linked record + recipient + purpose. Acknowledging marks it read; action completion only on action-required notifications. Rule thresholds fill warn / escalate times; escalations are category Escalation with no further timers.

Not in the database (app / worker jobs): creating tasks and notifications from events, sending reminders, collections escalation (Day −3 … Day 30, broken promises), staffed-hours SLA calculation.

## Phase 6 — Management & extras ✅

| Table / view | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app_settings` | Admin-editable key/value settings (timezone, alumni support months, refund targets, SLA at-risk minutes) |
| `branch_shifts`, `holidays` | Staffed hours per branch per weekday, and holidays (branch or all). Seeded placeholder: Mon–Sat 09:00–19:00 |
| `target_versions`, `target_lines` | Target Master: version (`TM-2026-10-v1`) with a period, approved as a whole; one line per branch plus Company (NULL branch); NULL measure = Not Set |
| `support_extensions` | Alumni support extensions beyond the standard period |
| `companies`, `job_openings` | Employers and openings (`JOB-00001`): title, type, mode, location, skills, CTC, source, last verified, owner, status |
| `placement_profiles` | One per person: readiness, CV + review, skills, preferences, referral consent, evidence status |
| `job_applications`, `application_events` | Pipeline Applied → Shortlisted → Interview Scheduled → Interview Attended → Selected → Offer Received → Offer Accepted → Joined (+ Rejected / Withdrawn / Offer Declined); timeline incl. interview no-shows |
| `integration_status` | Seeded from prototype: WhatsApp (Manual), Email, Telephony, HDFC, LMS (Planned), Scheduled report email (Configured) |
| `incidents` | Incident register (`IR-00001`): severity, owner, status, resolution, backup reference |
| `scheduled_reports` | Report schedules: frequency, time, period, recipients, format, last delivery |
| `target_achievement` (view) | Approved targets vs actual verified collections (collecting branch, payment date) and paid admissions (original branch, first verified payment date), with % |
| `alumni` (view) | People with at least one authorised completion; alumni since, also-active flag, support until / active |

Also added: `add_staffed_minutes(branch_id, start, minutes)` → deadline in staffed time (skips closed hours, off days, holidays); `admissions.academic_completed_at`, `completion_authorised_by`, `support_until`.

Rules enforced by the database:
- Approving a target version needs an approver; it automatically supersedes any overlapping approved version (history kept). Only one approved version can cover a day. Lines are locked once the version leaves Draft; superseded versions can't be re-approved.
- Marking an admission `Completed` needs `completion_authorised_by`; it stamps completion time and `support_until` (+6 months from `app_settings`).
- Support extensions: Founder / CEO or Super Admin only; must be later than the current end; updates `admissions.support_until`.
- Placement: applications need explicit referral consent and an Open job; one application per profile per job; every stage change is logged; `Joined` needs a joined date; a no-show is an event, not a closure.
- Incidents: resolving stamps `resolved_at`. Scheduled reports need at least one recipient.

## Prototype alignment (009–010) ✅

A full text review of the prototype found rules the phase-by-phase build had missed or contradicted. These migrations fix them.

### Changed decisions
| Area | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Roles | One `users.role_id`; invented Counsellor / Admissions | `user_role_scopes`: many role + branch scopes per user, with expiry / revocation. Roles: Founder / CEO, Super Admin, Branch Manager, Sales, Front Office, Accounts, Academic Coordinator, Trainer, Placement Team, HR, Student. `user_has_role(user, roles[], branch)` for checks. `users.role_id`, `home_branch_id` and `user_branches` removed |
| Payments vs admission | Payment needed an admission | Payments belong to a **person**; they can be an unallocated advance, allocated to an accepted fee discussion, or to an admission. Each allocation link is set once |
| Admission | Could be created any time | Needs (1) an accepted confirmed delivery plan on the fee version and (2) a Verified payment allocated to that discussion. Creation links those payments, moves the lead to Admitted and the discussion to Converted |
| 70% floor | Hard block | Advisory. Below-floor approval needs Founder / CEO or Super Admin **plus** an independent approver on the special closing request |
| Extra concession | Could be saved as Approved directly | A version with extra concession (or below floor) is Approved only after a matching special closing request is Approved |
| Fee after admission | Frozen forever | `admission_fee_changes`: Founder / CEO or Super Admin approves (self-approval allowed since 023), Accounts or an admin applies (024); installments are rebuilt; can't go below verified payments |
| Lookup values | Partly invented | Prototype values: sources, channels, entry methods, payment modes (Cheque is exception-only and needs an independent approver), intake status (New / Incomplete / Duplicate Review / Outreach Prospect) |
| Lead stages | Could move anywhere | Admitted is final; Payment Pending Verification can only go to Admitted or Lost |

### Added
| Table / view / function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `enquiries` | Every enquiry (`ENQ-00001`) incl. repeats; lead keeps `original_source_id` / `original_channel_id` / `original_entry_method_id` / `original_enquiry_id`; `is_genuine` for "Genuine Enquiries" |
| `leads.ai_score`, priority "Waiting for Batch / Future Joining" | "Hot · 92" |
| `demos.demo_type`, `extra_demo_approved_by`, `commercial_follow_up_due_at` | Standard ≤ 45 min, Practical ≤ 60; 3rd demo after 2 attended needs Academic Coordinator / Branch Manager; follow-up due 2 staffed hours after attendance |
| `fee_discussions` delivery plan fields, `fee_shared_at` | Accepted confirmed delivery plan (version, mode, seat type, planned start); "Fee Shared" milestone |
| `special_closing_requests` counteroffer + independent approval | Approve / Counteroffer / Reject; decision due = 5 **staffed** minutes; approver limit = highest across their scopes |
| `payment_plan_installments.due_days_min/max` | Due-date windows; seeded Two Instalments (50% Day 0 + 50% Day 10–15, default 12) and Three Instalments (50/25/25 Day 0/10/15) |
| Complimentary admissions | `admissions.complimentary_of_admission_id`, `offer_id`, `access_until`; `offer_complimentary_courses.access_period_days`; needs an active offer, fee threshold and a verified qualifying payment |
| `admissions.seat_type`, `planned_start_date`, record / finance / academic owners | Confirmed Seat vs Future Plan |
| `batch_allocation_queue` (view) | Allocate-by (confirmed: 1 working day and before first class; future: 48h before start) and escalate-at (24h before start) |
| `curriculum_versions`, `admission_curricula` | "Published v2026.1"; `Mapped` needs a mapping |
| `support_cases`, `support_case_types` | General support cases (`SUP-00001`), optionally linked to a refund case |
| `ai_insights`, `ai_queries`, `ai_feedback` | Briefs, priority explanations, suggested messages, Ask Nipuna Q&A with sources / scope / freshness; feedback Helpful / Incorrect / Not Useful / Missing Context |
| `user_sessions`, `active_sessions` (view) | 30-min idle timeout, 12-hour max, fresh-auth flag |
| `deletion_requests` | Sensitive deletion needs an independent approver |
| `report_runs`, `scheduled_reports.schedule_day` | Cutoff / refresh / completeness log; weekly and monthly schedules |
| `unallocated_advances` (view), `admission_balances.payment_completion` | Unpaid / Part Paid / Paid |
| `persons.preferred_language` | English / Telugu |
| Refund targets | `decision_due_at` = 7 working days, `payout_due_at` = 18 working days after approval |
| `add_working_days()`, `working_day_end()`, `business_tz()` | Working-day helpers |
| Tasks | Can link to support cases and enquiries |

## Prototype v1.1 alignment (012) ✅

Source: the Lovable project's code (`prototype/`), checked by running it with Playwright.

### Changed decisions
| Area | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Invoice | `fee_discussions.invoice_number` | `invoices` table (`INV-GNT-2627-0001`, per collecting branch + FY), issued from an **Approved** fee version; carries Day 0, agreed due days, terms, plan. Re-issuing before any payment supersedes the old invoice; invoices are immutable except status and a fee-change revision |
| Instalments | Built per admission at admission time | Built per **invoice** when it's issued (Day 0 + agreed days or plan defaults), so dues exist before the admission (`installments.invoice_id`; `admission_id` removed) |
| Payment allocation | To a fee discussion or an admission | To an **invoice** (`payments.invoice_id`; NULL = unallocated advance). `admission_id` is filled automatically. Cap = invoice billed amount |
| Admission | From an accepted fee version + verified payment on the discussion | From an **invoice** (`admissions.invoice_id`): accepted plan on the invoice's version + a verified payment on the invoice. Records `first_qualifying_payment_id`. Parties, fee and plan come from the invoice |
| Reversals | Inserted directly | Only through `payment_correction_requests`: requested by Accounts / Founder / Super Admin for a Verified, un-reversed receipt; decided by a *distinct* Founder / CEO or Super Admin; approval appends the reversal (`REV-GNT-2627-00001`, verified by the approver) |
| Fee change | Updated admission + instalments | Also revises the invoice amount (`original_billed_amount`, `revised_at`) |
| Batch allocation | Any branch; curriculum not checked | Same service branch only; curriculum must be Mapped (and match the batch's curriculum version); Paused / Completed / Cancelled enrolments blocked |
| Demo reminders | Three timestamp columns | `demo_reminders` rows (Booking confirmation / 24h / 1h) created on booking, **Skipped** if already past, **Superseded** on reschedule, **Cleared** on cancel, **Not needed** after attendance / no-show |

### Added
| Table / column / view | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `invoices`, `invoice_balances` (view) | Invoice register: billed, verified paid, pending (never counted), waived, outstanding, completion, state |
| `payment_correction_requests` | `CR-GNT-0001`; one pending per receipt; links the reversal it produced |
| `demo_reminders`; `demos.demo_code` (`DM-GNT-0001`), `trainer_feedback`, `outcome`, `recommended_course_id`, `commercial_owner_id`, `next_follow_up_at`, `cancel_reason`, `reschedule_reason` | Demo scheduling, outcomes and reminders (`feedback` → `student_feedback`, `next_step` → `next_action`) |
| `lead_imports`, `lead_import_rows` | CSV import review: row validation issues, Ready / Duplicate Review / Invalid / Imported, created lead |
| `saved_views` | Lead list saved filters (5 shared views seeded) |
| `leads.campaign`, `leads.remarks`, `persons.whatsapp_number` | Lead capture fields |
| `lead_activities.purpose`, `lead_activities.demo_id` | Follow-up log (purpose + response) and demo timeline entries |
| `batches.curriculum_version_id`, `location`, `min_students`; `batch_occupancy.is_full` | Batch workspace |
| `payments.proof_file_path` | Payment proof |
| `tasks.invoice_id`, `tasks.correction_request_id` | Task links |
| Lookups | Source `Meta Ads`, entry method `CSV import`, intake statuses `Invalid-Spam`, `Test` |
| Views rebuilt | `installment_dues` (invoice level, includes pre-admission invoices), `unallocated_advances` |

## Demo course optional (013) ✅

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| `demos.course_id` is nullable (NULL = no course chosen at booking) | A lead can attend a demo before deciding on a course. Booking uses the course passed in, else the lead's course, else none. `recommended_course_id` still records the course suggested after the demo |

## Lead intake → genuine enquiries (014) ✅

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| `trg_leads_sync_enquiry_genuine` (AFTER UPDATE OF `leads.intake_status`) → `sync_lead_intake_to_enquiries()` | Staff classify the lead, but the Genuine Enquiries count reads `enquiries`. Moving a lead into Invalid-Spam / Test sets `is_genuine = FALSE` on all its enquiries; moving it out sets `is_genuine = TRUE` (re-classified by staff); other status changes leave enquiries alone |
| Backfill | Enquiries of leads already in Invalid-Spam / Test with `is_genuine` NULL → FALSE |

## Offer once per person (015) ✅

A person can use each offer only once. "Using" an offer = an admission that applies it — as the offer on the admission's fee version (discount offers) or as the offer granting a complimentary admission. All versions of an offer (same `offer_code`) are the same offer.

| Added | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `person_offer_redemptions` (view) | Every non-cancelled admission that applied an offer: person, offer code / id, admission, `redemption_admission_id` (the paid admission for complimentary courses), used as Fee offer / Complimentary course |
| `check_offer_once_per_person()` + `trg_admissions_z_offer_once` (BEFORE INSERT on `admissions`, after `trg_admissions_before_insert`) | Refuses an admission whose offer the person already used on a different admission: "Offer X has already been used by this person (admission NIT-…); an offer can be used only once per person". Takes a per-person advisory lock so two concurrent admissions can't both use it |

Rules:
- The paid admission and the complimentary course(s) granted on top of it are one use.
- Cancelled admissions don't count — cancelling the admission that used an offer makes it available to that person again (assumption, to confirm).
- The API also hides used offers from the fee version picker and refuses them when saving a version or issuing an invoice, so the block normally shows before any payment.

## Complimentary rules (016) ✅

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| `trg_admissions_zz_complimentary_rules` (BEFORE INSERT on `admissions`) → `check_complimentary_rules()` | An offer listing several complimentary courses gave all of them on one paid admission, and a free course could duplicate one the learner already had (found on PER-GNT-00082: two DIWALI freebies, one the same Data Science course she paid for) |
| Rule 1 | One complimentary admission per offer (same `offer_code`, any version) per paid admission |
| Rule 2 | The complimentary course can't be one the person already has a non-cancelled admission for |
| Order | `zz_` runs after `trg_admissions_z_offer_once`, so "offer already used" wins when both apply. Cancelled admissions don't count; existing rows are not changed |

## Person pipeline (017) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

The pipeline tracks persons, not leads. A lead is an enquiry for one course. It is **Active** while at New Enquiry. On its first stage change it becomes **Inactive** (it leaves the Leads list) and the person joins a **pipeline entry** (card), with one card per person per branch.

| Added | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lead_status` enum (`Active`, `Inactive`) | `leads.lead_status` is generated from `stage`: Active = New Enquiry, Inactive = anything else |
| `pipeline_entries` | Card: `entry_code` (`PL-GNT-00001`), person, branch, shared stage, owner, next follow-up, AI priority / score, lost reason / competitor / notes / reactivation date, `closed_at`. Stage is never New Enquiry. Only one open card per person per branch |
| `leads.pipeline_entry_id` | The card a lead belongs to (kept after the lead or card closes, as history) |
| `attach_lead_to_pipeline()` (BEFORE INSERT / UPDATE OF stage on `leads`, `b_` between the guard and the logger) | A lead leaving New Enquiry joins the person's open card at that branch (taking the card's stage) or opens a new card at its new stage. While a card is open, a new lead for that person and branch joins it straight away |
| `sync_pipeline_from_lead()` (AFTER INSERT / UPDATE OF stage on `leads`) | Pulls the person's other New Enquiry leads at the branch onto the card; moving an open lead moves the card; closes the card when its last open course closes |
| `guard_pipeline_entry_stage()` + `cascade_pipeline_entry_stage()` (on `pipeline_entries`) | Card moves apply to every open lead on it. Lost copies the card's lost details to them |
| `guard_lead_stage()` (replaced) | Also refuses moving back to New Enquiry except from Lost (reactivation). The PPV rule can be bypassed only by the sync triggers |

Rules:
- All open courses on a card share one stage. Each lead's timeline still logs every change.
- Admitting or losing one course closes only that lead. The card closes when the last open course closes: **Admitted** if any course on it was admitted, otherwise **Lost**. A card can't be moved to Admitted by hand.
- If one course is admitted while the card is in Payment Pending Verification and other courses remain, the card goes back to Fee Discussion / Payment Awaited (assumption).
- Moving the card to Lost needs a lost reason and closes every open course on it.
- Closed cards never reopen. A later enquiry, or a Lost lead that is reactivated, opens a new card.
- A lead that goes straight from New Enquiry to Lost becomes Inactive without a card. Reactivating it to New Enquiry makes it Active again.
- Different branches get separate cards, each with its own stage and owner.
- A new card takes its owner, follow-up and priority from the lead that opened it (assumption). After that they are the card's own.

Backfill: one card per person and branch that had open leads past New Enquiry (68 cards on dev). The card takes the furthest stage among those leads, and the person's other open leads there move to it. Persons 66 and 120 each had two courses at different stages, so both of their courses are now at Payment Pending Verification. Admitted and Lost leads were not given cards.

API: see [API.md](API.md) step 5, "As built (person pipeline)". Screens: Pipeline (person cards), Persons and Person 360, and the Lead status filter on Leads.

## Flexible instalments (018) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

| Change | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fee_version_installments` | The version's payment schedule: `installment_no` (1–3), `due_date`, `amount`. Saved with the version and frozen (no update / delete; no insert once the version has an invoice) |
| `check_fee_version_schedule()` (deferred constraint trigger) | At commit: the count matches the plan (Full 1 / Two 2 / Three 3), numbered 1..n, amounts add up to `final_payable`, dates strictly in order |
| `check_fee_version_has_schedule()` (deferred, on `fee_discussion_versions`) | Every new version with a final payable above zero must have a schedule |
| `before_invoice_insert()` / `after_invoice_insert()` (replaced) | No agreed-due-days or window checks; `installments` are copied from the version's schedule (`agreed_due_days` is set to NULL) |
| `guard_installment_update()` (replaced) | Due dates can move to any date; amounts still change only through an applied fee change |
| `before_fee_change_write()` (replaced) | An applied fee change rescales the instalments in proportion to their current amounts (rounding into the last) |
| `admission_token_amount()`, `invoice_token_payment(invoice_id)` | Token setting (default ₹1,000) and the verified, un-reversed payment at which verified money reaches it (or the whole bill, if smaller) |
| `before_admission_insert()` (replaced) | Needs the token reached: "verified payments of at least ₹1000 (the admission token) — ₹600 verified so far". `first_qualifying_payment_id` = the payment that reached it |
| `payment_gaps` (view) | Open invoices with a verified payment whose next unpaid instalment is due more than `payment_gap_alert_days` after the last verified payment date: last payment, next instalment / due / balance, `gap_days`, outstanding |
| Settings | `admission_token_amount` 1000, `installment_due_soon_days` 2, `payment_gap_alert_days` 30 |
| Notification rules | `INSTALMENT_DUE_SOON` (daily job `dues-due-soon`: owner, Accounts, BM), `PAYMENT_GAP_LONG` (on verification: owner, Accounts, BM, Founder / CEO, Super Admin) |

Rules:
- The plans' percentages and due-day windows are no longer enforced. The screen starts with blank dates and amounts; the API uses the plan's split from today only when a request sends no schedule.
- Payments of any amount up to the invoice balance were already allowed (verified money covers the oldest instalment first). Money beyond the whole invoice still becomes an unallocated advance.
- Backfill: existing versions got their plan's split of the final payable, on their invoice's due dates if one was issued (else the plan's default days from the version date).
- "1 month" for the gap is 30 days (setting). The gap is measured from the last verified payment's date.

## V4 · Qualify and convert (019) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

| Added / changed | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `qualification_check` enum, `lead_qualification_reviews` | The six checks (genuine intent; reachable contact; intended course(s) understood; branch and delivery mode discussed; exact next action agreed; possible identity match reviewed — never auto-merged), with who ticked each and when |
| `leads.qualified_at/by`, `leads.converted_at/by` | Mark Qualified needs all six (`check_lead_qualification()`); the checklist is frozen afterwards; qualifying never changes the stage |
| `leads_pipeline_needs_conversion` (CHECK), `guard_lead_stage()` (replaced) | Any stage other than New Enquiry / Lost needs a conversion. Reactivating a Lost lead to New Enquiry clears the conversion (it is a lead again) |
| `attach_lead_to_pipeline()`, `sync_pipeline_from_lead()` (replaced) | A lead joins (or opens) the person's card only when a converted lead leaves New Enquiry. New Enquiry leads are no longer pulled onto an open card; a new lead for a person with an open card stays in Leads until converted (replaces 017's rule) |
| `pipeline_entries.expected_close_date` | Given at conversion; editable on the card |

Rules: convert only a qualified New Enquiry lead; the lead's own course must be included; other courses reuse the person (an open New Enquiry lead for that course is converted; an existing deal is returned, never duplicated; otherwise a lead is created). Conversion creates no admission, receipt or LMS access. Moving an unconverted lead straight to Lost is still allowed.

Backfill: leads on a card or past New Enquiry are marked qualified and converted (at their creation time).

## V4 · Delivery plans (020) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

| Added / changed | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `delivery_plans` (`DP-00001`), `capacity_review` enum | One plan per course deal: service branch, mode, seat type (Confirmed Seat / Future Plan), planned start (required for Future Plan), capacity review (Checked / Waiting), student acceptance captured, accepted by / at |
| `guard_delivery_plan()`, `prevent_delivery_plan_delete()` | Only converted, open deals; an accepted plan is frozen until reopened (reopening clears the acceptance); plans are never deleted |
| `fee_discussions` delivery columns dropped | `accepted_version_id`, `delivery_mode`, `seat_type`, `planned_start_date`, `plan_accepted_at/by` moved into `delivery_plans` (19 accepted plans migrated on dev) |
| `before_admission_insert()` (replaced) | Needs the course's accepted plan; the admission takes service branch, mode, seat type and start from it |

## V4 · Multi-course invoices (021) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

| Added / changed | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `branches.legal_name`, `branches.invoice_accent` | Issuer name and template colour (Guntur `#6251DA`, Vijayawada `#137E89`); addresses / phones / emails seeded from the V4 handoff |
| `invoices.issuer_*` | Snapshot of the issuing branch at issue time — later branch edits (or a viewer's branch filter) never change an issued invoice |
| `invoices` course columns dropped | `fee_discussion_id`, `fee_version_id`, `lead_id`, `course_id`, `agreed_due_days` moved to lines; `billed_amount` / `standard_fee` are the sum of the lines |
| `invoice_lines` (`INV-GNT-2627-0001-L1`) | One line per course deal: lead, fee discussion, approved version, course, delivery plan, standard fee, amount. `before_invoice_line_insert()` checks eligibility: same person and branch, converted and open, current version Approved, accepted delivery plan, not on another Issued invoice; lines are added only while the invoice is being issued |
| `check_invoice_complete()` (deferred) | At commit: at least one line; 1–3 instalments matching the plan count, numbered, dates in order, adding up to the total |
| `guard_installment_insert()` | The schedule is written with the invoice (it no longer comes from the fee version; versions need no schedule) |
| `payment_allocations` | How much of each payment went to each course line (reversals negate them). `before_payment_allocation_insert()` caps each line (pending counts, waivers excluded); `check_payment_allocations_total()` (deferred) makes an invoice payment fully allocated and an advance unallocated |
| `invoice_line_balances` (view); `invoice_balances`, `admission_balances`, `installment_dues`, `payment_gaps` (rebuilt) | Per-course verified / pending / waived / outstanding / open-to-allocate; invoice totals from the lines; instalment dues stay at invoice level (oldest instalment first) |
| `admissions.invoice_line_id` (unique), `invoice_line_token_payment()` | One admission per course line; it needs verified money on the line reaching ₹1,000 (or the whole line). `admissions.invoice_id` is no longer unique |
| `payments.admission_id` | Kept as "the admission, when the whole payment went to one admitted course line" (maintained by triggers) |
| `payment_promises.invoice_id` | Promises to pay are per invoice (`admission_id` optional) |
| `before_fee_change_write()`, `check_refund_decision()` (replaced) | A fee change revises its line; the invoice total follows and instalments rescale. Refund approval is capped by the line's verified money |
| `after_invoice_status_change()` | Cancelling an unpaid invoice sends its courses' discussions back to Fee Shared / Approved so they can be invoiced again (re-issue no longer supersedes automatically) |

Backfill: every existing invoice became a one-line invoice; payments were allocated to that line; admissions linked to it; promises moved to the admission's invoice.

## V4 · Transactions and receipts (022) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

| Added / changed | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `payments.transaction_number` (`TXN-GNT-00001`) | Given when a payment is recorded (per collecting branch) |
| `payments.receipt_number` (nullable), `next_receipt_number()` | Issued only when the payment is verified (`GNT-R-2627-00001`); reversals keep `REV-…`; failed claims never get one |
| `payments.evidence_reviewed`, `payments.cash_checked` | Recorded with the verification decision; Verified needs the evidence review, and a cash payment the independent cash check |
| `unallocated_advances`, `task_board` (views) | Carry the transaction number (the task link shows the receipt, else the transaction) |

Backfill: transaction numbers in recording order; pending and failed payments lost the receipt number they had been given at recording; verified ones were marked as checked.

## V4 · Fee change self-approval (023) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

Dropped `fee_changes_no_self_approval` on `admission_fee_changes`. Only Founder / CEO and Super Admin can approve a fee change (trigger `before_fee_change_write`), so the check only ever blocked them; they may now approve their own request. Counsellors / Branch Managers still only request; Accounts still applies.

## Admin Accounts access (024) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

`before_fee_change_write` now accepts Accounts, Founder / CEO or Super Admin as `accounts_corrected_by` when a fee change is applied. The API and UI also let admins do refund payout and reconcile (no database role check there). Unchanged: a fee can't go below verified payments.

## Admin refund payout (025) ✅ (applied to `nipunacrm-dev` only)

Dropped `refund_separation_of_duties` on `refund_cases`. Only Founder / CEO or Super Admin can decide a refund (`check_refund_decision`), so the check only ever blocked them; an admin may now pay out a refund they decided. Payout still needs an approved refund, stays within the approved amount and needs reconciliation before Completed.
